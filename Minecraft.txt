Creeper, aww man

So we back in the mine
got a pickaxe swingin' from side to side, side, side to side
This task a grueling one
hope to find some diamonds tonight night night, diamonds tonight

cause baby tonight, the creepers trying to steal stuff again 
cause baby tonight, grab your pick shovel and bolt again, bolt again, 'gain

And run, run, until it's done, done
Until the sun turns up in the morn'

cause baby tonight, ...
